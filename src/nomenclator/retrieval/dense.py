"""Semantic retrieval index based on sentence embeddings.

This module provides a lightweight in-memory semantic search index built on
top of sentence embeddings. Documents are embedded once during indexing and
queries are embedded at search time to retrieve the most semantically similar
documents.

The implementation is adapted from the Semble project:
https://github.com/MinishLab/semble

The index is intentionally independent of any application domain. It operates
on embedding vectors and similarity search only, making it suitable for use in
hybrid retrieval pipelines alongside lexical search methods such as BM25.
